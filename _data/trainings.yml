  Title: Ethical Hacking for Beginners
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOuDe84Hc1hBGm
  SectionId: sku_HOuDe84Hc1hBGm
  Description: "This course is based on Ethical Hacking also known as Penetration Testing. The hacking, when 
    done in ethical ways with the permission of the asset owner, turns out to be quite effective for 
    organizations to find out the vulnerabilities in their environment of information systems and enable them 
    to fix those weaknesses before malicious hackers or adversaries may exploit their systems. This kind of 
    hacking is classified as White Hat Hacking. This course is formulated to make the students aware of various 
    hacking tools being used in the industry by cybersecurity professionals. The methodology of the course 
    covers more than 90% practical hands-on approach.<br>
    Learning Outcomes: Students will be able to distinguish ethical hacking from malicious hacking knowing the 
    concepts of White Hat and Black Hat hacking. They will get hands-on knowledge to perform the hacking tasks 
    in ethical ways to improve the security of assets by using various hacking tools.<br>
    <strong>Resources for hands-on approach:</strong><br>
    <ol>
    <li>Attack side: Kali Linux 2020.x, NMAP, Metasploit Framework (MSF).</li>
    <li>Victim side: Metasploitable, MS Windows 10, OWASP Resources i.e. Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and buggy Web Application (bWAPP).</li>
    </ol>
    Note: The above resources will be installed and organized in a virtual environment i.e. Oracle VM 
    Virtualbox."

  Title: "Fuzzing: An effective alternative to code review and penetration testing"
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOuGOMSbuaiIro
  SectionId: sku_HOuGOMSbuaiIro
  Description: "Conducting an effective application penetration testing requires 
    specialized knowledge and experience. Penetration tests are costly and often only 
    considered at, or towards the end of any software development process. On the other 
    hand, most software companies and specially start-ups do not have any resources to 
    invest in source code reviews. These considered, if done correctly, fuzzing can 
    provide an effective alternative that can easily be included in any secure software 
    development process.<br>
    This course aims to provide a strong base to use fuzzing as an effective alternative 
    to discover vulnerabilities. Attendees will gain usable knowledge on fuzzing, learn 
    to build an effective wordlist, use Python to build application specific fuzzing tools 
    and see use cases to discover OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities using fuzzing. The course 
    will also provide guidelines to include fuzzing in the software development process 
    and the possible use of machine learning and baseline analysis to enrich returns from 
    fuzzing."

  Description: This course gives insight into automation capabilities of security scans,
    which perfectly fit into many build pipelines. Taking into account frontends (Web)
    as well as backends (APIs), you will learn what steps of a security analysis can be
    best automated – and how. By focussing on OpenSource solutions (OWASP ZAP), you will
    get a tool arsenal with different automation options ready to test your application’s
    security on every build. During this workshop we will enhance a typical Jenkins-based
    CI/CD pipeline (every attendee will get an individual Jenkins server in the cloud
    ready to use with multiple levels of tool integrations) with a specially prepared
    vulnerable training application step by step into a full-fledged awesome DevSecOps

      Biography: "AviD is a high-end, independent security architect and developer, with 
        decades of experience implementing security requirements and protecting complex 
        systems. He has been designing, developing, and testing secure applications for 
        over 20 years, and is obsessed with maximizing value output from security efforts, 
        since originally building threat models at Microsoft over a dozen years ago.<br>
        Avi leads consulting at Bounce Security, where he supports organizations of all 
        sizes in integrating security methodologies and products into their development 
        processes, often providing training on secure coding and other security topics. 
        We utilize various methodologies as circumstances demand, and adjust accordingly. 
        Recently, our relentless drive to optimize security investment and threat modeling 
        in particular, has led us to adapt the classic threat modeling methodology to a 
        more agile workflow in order to empower developers and agile R&D teams.<br>
        Mr. Douglen is a frequent trainer and speaker at industry conferences, such as 
        OWASP, RSA, BSides, and Infosec, as well as developer conferences such as O’Reilly, 
        DevSecCon, PyCon, and DevOpsDays. He has trained hundreds of developers on security, 
        including secure coding, security architecture, threat modeling, and more.<br>
        Avi also co-founded the OWASP Threat Modeling project, and is one of the project 
        leaders. He also leads the OWASP Israel chapter, and created the successful AppSec 
        Israel security conference. He volunteers as a high school tech teacher and mentor,

  Title: "Secure By Design: Threat Modeling For Developers"
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOuKN2MC5W2mfv
  SectionId: sku_HOuKN2MC5W2mfv
  Description: "You’ve decided that your products require a higher level of security, and 
    now you need to start introducing security into your software design activities. But 
    with a focus on quick delivery, your team doesn't have much bandwidth to discuss 
    quality or security, let alone integrate heavyweight security activities into the 
    development workflow...<br> 
    *Threat Modeling* is one of the most effective security activities that can be 
    performed for a software application. Using a structured methodology for 
    security-based analysis of a complex system can help you identify and prioritize 
    potential threats and attack vectors, and understand the appropriate mitigations. A 
    good threat model is essential for a robust, secure design and architecture, and can 
    support mitigation of all relevant threats. This can also build customer confidence.<br>
    As a developer, you want to be empowered to contribute to the security design, and 
    take ownership of the security features in your products. With training and some 
    tangible experience, you could independently create the threat models for your 
    applications and design a more secure architecture, easing the load off your security 
    team, and creating deeper integration and a higher level of security than enforcing it 
    externally.<br>
    This Threat Modeling Workshop will kickstart your security design efforts, teach your 
    developers the skills required to build their own threat models for your products, and 
    train with actual hands-on experience so that you are confident to continue designing 
    secure products based on threat modeling."
