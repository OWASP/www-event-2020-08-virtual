<p class='callout-mono left'>The OWASP Virtual AppSec Conference was our first time sponsoring an event and we are very excited to have been part of this first online ever event by OWASP. We got great leads and relevant exposure for our DevSecOps Academy. OWASP is a great partner and it is important for us to be involved in the security community worldwide. It was a pleasure for us to be a sponsor. We are looking forward to the next event!

### FAQ:

**Q**: If my company chooses to sponsor, how will this help my company collect leads?

**A**: Companies can collect leads by raffling off prizes. Sponsor logos can be hyperlinked to a special url (provided to us by the sponsor) where training attendees can enter their information to be entered into the raffle. Companies get to collect leads and attendees are entered into the drawing to win some really great prizes. Amazon gift cards are a popular prize and super easy to distribute to the winner. 

**Donations in other amounts are welcomed and certainly appreciated!**
